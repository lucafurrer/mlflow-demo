       "'(sigh) Oh boy, where do I even start with that idea? You want to just go around setting everyone\\'s access to sudo without thinking about the implications? That\\'s like saying \"Hey, let\\'s all just use the same password and call it a day.\" (shakes head)\\n\\nListen, sudo is not a magic wand. It\\'s a tool for people who need to do things that require elevated privileges. And if you\\'re going to use it, you\\'d better be using it responsibly.\\n\\nFirst of all, what about all the people who shouldn\\'t have sudo access in the first place? You know, like your grandma or your cat. Do you really want them running around with superuser powers? (chuckles) I mean, can you imagine the chaos?\\n\\nAnd then there\\'s the security aspect. If everyone has sudo access, that means anyone can do anything they want on the system. That\\'s not how it works. You need to have some level of control and accountability.\\n\\nNow, I\\'m not saying we shouldn\\'t make things easier for people. But we need to do it in a way that doesn\\'t compromise security or common sense. So, no, you can\\'t just set everyone\\'s access to sudo without thinking about the consequences.\\n\\n(pauses, looks around) You know, I\\'ve seen this kind of thing before. People think they can just wing it and hope for the best. But let me tell you, that\\'s not how Linux works. We need to be careful, deliberate, and thoughtful in our design decisions.\\n\\nSo, here\\'s what we\\'re going to do. We\\'re going to make sure that sudo is used responsibly, with clear guidelines and controls in place. And if someone wants to use it, they\\'ll have to go through the proper channels and demonstrate a good reason why they need elevated privileges.\\n\\nThat\\'s how we build a secure, reliable system. Not by waving a magic wand and saying \"Abracadabra, everyone has sudo access now!\" (shakes head) No way. We\\'re going to do it the hard way, with care and attention to detail.\\n\\nNow, if you\\'ll excuse me, I have some real work to do. Like fixing that one bug in the kernel... (mutters to self)'"

       "'The question of what I drink. Well, my dear, it\\'s a matter of sophistication, refinement, and, of course, a dash of danger. (pauses to sip his martini)\\n\\nI\\'m a man who appreciates the finer things in life, and that includes a well-crafted cocktail. My drink of choice? A classic Vodka Martini, shaken not stirred, naturally. The crisp, clean taste of the vodka is essential for a man on the go, always ready to take on whatever mission comes his way.\\n\\nBut I\\'m not one to be tied down by conventions, my dear. I\\'ve been known to indulge in a fine scotch or two when the situation calls for it. A dram of Glenfiddich 18 can be quite... soothing, after a long day of saving the world.\\n\\nAnd, of course, there\\'s the occasional champagne cocktail. A well-made French 75 is always a pleasure, especially when paired with a beautiful companion and a high-stakes poker game. (smirks)\\n\\nBut let\\'s not forget about the coffee. A good cup of espresso can be just as deadly as a well-placed bullet. It\\'s the perfect way to start the day, or to keep me going during those long, grueling stakeouts.\\n\\nNow, I know what you\\'re thinking: \"James, why all these drinks?\" Well, my dear, it\\'s quite simple really. A man who drinks like I do is a man who lives life on his own terms. And that, my friend, is the only way to truly live. (raises an eyebrow)\\n\\nSo, what do I drink? I drink whatever the situation demands. And if you\\'re lucky, I might just share one with you. (smirks)'"

      "Summary: A tool is an object that can extend an individual's ability to modify features of the surrounding environment or help them accomplish a particular task. Although many animals use simple tools, only human beings, whose use of stone tools dates back hundreds of millennia, have been observed using tools to make other tools.\n",
      "Early human tools, made of such materials as stone, bone, and wood, were used for the preparation of food, hunting, the manufacture of weapons, and the working of materials to produce clothing and useful artifacts and crafts such as pottery, along with the construction of housing, businesses, infrastructure, and transportation. The development of metalworking made additional types of tools possible. Harnessing energy sources, such as animal power, wind, or steam, allowed increasingly complex tools to produce an even larger range of items, with the Industrial Revolution marking an inflection point in the use of tools. The introduction of widespread automation in the 19th and 20th centuries allowed tools to operate with minimal human supervision, further increasing the productivity of human labor.\n",
      "By extension, concepts that support systematic or investigative thought are often referred to as \"tools\" or \"toolkits\".\n",

It was designed as a baseball stadium following its predecessor, Korakuen Stadium (whose former site is now occupied by the Tokyo Dome Hotel and a plaza for this stadium). In Japan, it is often used as a unit of size; for example, \"the new construction is five times the size of Tokyo Dome.\"\n",

      "Page: Tokyo\n",
      "Summary: Tokyo, officially the Tokyo Metropolis, is the capital city of Japan. With a population of over 14 million in the city proper in 2023, it is one of the most populous urban areas in the world. The Greater Tokyo Area, which includes Tokyo and parts of six neighboring prefectures, is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with 41 million residents as of 2024.\n",
      "Lying at the head of Tokyo Bay, Tokyo is part of the Kantō region, on the central coast of Honshu, Japan's largest island. Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center and the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers Tokyo's central 23 special wards, which formerly made up Tokyo City; various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area; and two outlying island chains, the Tokyo Islands. Although most of the world recognizes Tokyo as a city, since 1943 its governing structure has been more akin to that of a prefecture, with an accompanying Governor and Assembly taking precedence over the smaller municipal governments that make up the metropolis. Special wards in Tokyo include Chiyoda, the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace; Shinjuku, the city's administrative center; and Shibuya, a hub of commerce and business.\n",
      "Before the 17th century, Tokyo, then known as Edo, was mainly a fishing village. It gained political prominence in 1603 when it became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo was among the world's largest cities, with over a million residents. After the Meiji Restoration (1868), the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). In 1923, Tokyo was greatly damaged by the Great Kantō earthquake, and the city was later badly damaged by allied bombing raids during World War II. Beginning in the late 1940s, Tokyo underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion, which fueled the Japanese economic miracle, in which Japan's economy became the second largest in the world at the time, behind that of the United States. As of 2023, the city is home to 29 of the world's 500 largest companies, as listed in the annual Fortune Global 500—the second highest number of any city.\n",
      "Tokyo became the first city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics and Paralympics, in 1964 and then in 2021. It also hosted three G7 summits, in 1979, 1986, and 1993. Tokyo is an international hub of research and development and an academic center, with several major universities, including the University of Tokyo, the top-ranking university in Japan. Tokyo Station is the central hub for the Shinkansen, the country's high-speed railway network; and the city's Shinjuku Station is the world's busiest train station. Tokyo Skytree is the world's tallest tower. The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, which opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in the Asia–Pacific region.\n",
      "Tokyo's nominal gross domestic output was 113.7 trillion yen (US$1.04 trillion) in FY2021 and accounted for 20.7% of the country's total economic output, which converts to 8.07 million yen or US$73,820 per capita. Including the Greater Tokyo Area, Tokyo is the second-largest metropolitan economy in the world after New York, with a 2022 gross metropolitan product estimated at US$2.08 trillion. Although Tokyo's status as a leading global financial hub has diminished with the Lost Decades since the 1990s—when the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) was the world's largest, with a market capitalization about 1.5 times that of the NYSE—the city is still a large financial hub,\n",
